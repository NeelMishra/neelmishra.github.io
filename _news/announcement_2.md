Happy to announce that I got accepted into the [School of AI](https://picampus-school.com/programme/school-of-ai/) program at Pi School. This is a fully sponsored program and I will be travelling to Rome, Italy to work on a project from [Translated](https://translated.com/welcome).

### Update December 2019

I have finished the program and returned back home. 

My task here was to work on speeding up translation inference which could help train and infer faster for the translation queries received. I worked with transformers and dynamic convolution mechanism instead of self-attention which speed up the model. I was mentored by [Sébastien Bratières](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastien-bratieres).
