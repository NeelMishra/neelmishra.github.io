I am a research engineer at Qualcomm XR, focusing on Human body animation utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques.

My academic journey includes earning an MS by research from IIIT Hyderabad, where I developed "marl-jax," a MARL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) framework with a specific emphasis on achieving social generalization.

Beyond my professional commitments, I actively contribute to the open-source community. You can find my contributions to projects such as Cleanrl and other RL libraries during my free time.

Prior to my time at IIIT Hyderabad, I gained valuable experience working on diverse projects in the realms of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision.

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and applying learning algorithms to solve real-world challenges.
